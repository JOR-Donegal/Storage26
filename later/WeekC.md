# Week 3
When we try to classify storage, it gets complicated! We can break up a storage medium like a disc into multiple volumes. Or we can aggregate multiple discs together to create a single volume.

In this week's notes, I want to introduce some of these concepts and some terminology.

If this area is completely new to you, you're about to experience many new concepts. From the administrator trying to do systems recovery, these ideas are fundamental. When we teach forensics, trying to find hidden data for example, these ideas are fundamental. To understand storage, we must get a little way into this world. The best book for practitioners that I have come across is _File System Forensic Analysis_ by Brian Carrier (ISBN: 978-0321268174). It is intended for security and forensics practitioners, but it’s the best reference I can suggest.
