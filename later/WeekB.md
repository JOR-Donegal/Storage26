# Week 2
We can look more deeply at hardware this week. Any computer has a design that is a sequence of compromises. We aim for characteristics like speed and capacity, but these are tempered by cost. For the main memory of a computer, we use several different technologies, all the trade off between cost and performance. I need to go through the memory hierarchy this week, in reality, this knowledge applies across all the modules.

By the time we get a ew weeks in, you will see that the performance of a storage system is optimized by understanding the entire memory stack.
Keep the outputs from the practical work, you will be submitting a lab report at the end of this work.

## Theory
1. We will look at the [memory heirarchy]() this week.

## Practice
1. We need to examine the workings of any operating system with regard to the memory heirarchy. I will get you to do some exercies in Windows, but we could equally do this in any OS.
