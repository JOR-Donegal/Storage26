Welcome to this program of study, Storage . I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11. This iteration of the module was arranged for e-delivery for remote students. I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started. The major areas covered in weeks 2-11 are Hardware Reliability Engineering Storage Organisation and Design Technology Data Storage Management I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it. This module is intended for students who already have some background in scripting and automation, networking and operating systems. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. The content and structure of this module was created c. 2015 and last revised in 2022. It is updated annually. Over the years, as I've tried to teach low level data storage structures theoretically with poor outcomes in terms of student learning. In the early part of this course, I get you to work with some practical low-level data and metadata work, material I would normally only teach on a forensics course. This has given much better results in student understanding. You may find this difficult, but it is essential. If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my Getting Started notes to understand what you need. Copyright The content of these notes are (c) John ORaw 2026.

They are intended to be a starting point for your studies, not the end point.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This site contains basic notes in Storage Technology for MSc on Campus.

I provide some guidance here as to how you should approach this. Please use this as a guide when you were trying to produce report documentation for this module. When you need to write reports for an academic programme of study, for conferences or academic journals, you need to start by finding out what the rules are. If I'm writing a paper for conference, I start by downloading the templates that the conference organisers provide. I read through it thoroughly to comply with it. Otherwise, I'm wasting my time making a submission. Part of the discipline of this module is for you to do the same. My template guidelines would be generally compliant with what is required in academia anywhere in the world. As these are short reports, I do not get you to do a literature review , and my conclusion has a prescribed format. Case study documents Some of the coursework associated with this module is intended to be done as an industry case study modeling what we might do on a real project. Even though this material is delivered at postgraduate level, we are not going to treat this writing as academic.

We can break up a storage medium like a disc into multiple volumes. Or we can aggregate multiple discs together to create a single volume. In this week's notes, I want to introduce some of these concepts and some terminology. If this area is completely new to you, you're about to experience many new concepts. From the administrator trying to do systems recovery, these ideas are fundamental. When we teach forensics, trying to find hidden data for example, these ideas are fundamental. To understand storage, we must get a little way into this world. The best book for practitioners that I have come across is File System Forensic Analysis by Brian Carrier (ISBN: 978-0321268174). It is intended for security and forensics practitioners, but it\u2019s the best reference I can suggest. Theory First we need to understand storage at the highest level. We define block, file, object and stream storage, read through my notes on Storage Organization . Once we have a storage volume, we need to break that up into usable partitions. Read through the notes on Volume Organization Practice You will find this week's exercises tough! We are going to map an MBR partition in exactly the way we would for data recovery. And then worse, we will do the same with a GPT partition. As always, save anything you need to create a report should you be required.","title":"Week 3"},{"location":"Content/c/#week-3","text":"When we try to classify storage, it gets complicated!

Theory I need to cover some simple storage technology to begin Practice In this week's practical work, I want you to directly examine Network Attached Storage (NAS). The definition for devices is often a little nebulous, but for my modules a NAS is a general purpose device to do file and block storage, and it may have a range of other functions. If I am working with a small business to define requirements and solutions for data storage, I will propose a cloud solution like Office 365. If the customer has constraints on their connectivity or does not want data in the cloud, a NAS is usually the correct answer. I would only propose a file server and domain controller once the business was big enough to have dedicated technical support staff. One of the most common and popular brands in use in Ireland is Synology . In this exercise, you are required to investigate a suitable Synology NAS for an SME which does have Internet connectivity. You want to store data locally but ideally you will have internet connectivity, cloud backup and disaster recovery. Investigate this product via the web demo. Identify: A suitable model of Synology NAS for an SME. The storage technology used by this device (e.g., RAID, Erasure Coding, other).
