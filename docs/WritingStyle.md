# Writing Style
Some of the coursework associated with this module is intended to be done as an industry case study modeling what we might do on a real project.

Even though this material is delivered at postgraduate level, we are not going to treat this writing as academic. Write it as if your lecturer were a projects manager and you are the engineering consultant.

I provide some guidance [here](https://jor-donegal.github.io/IndustryWriting/) on some of the typical documents I would provide on a project. Please use these as a guide when you were trying to produce case study documentation for this module.
