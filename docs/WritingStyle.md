# Writing Style
The coursework associated with this module is intended to be done as an industry case study. From the start we will look at typical industry documents and you will submit those as you go along, modeling what we might do on a real project.

Even though this material is delivered at postgraduate level, we are not going to treat this writing as academic. Write it as if your lecturer were a projects manager and you are the engineering consultant.

I provide some guidance [here](https://jor-donegal.github.io/IndustryWriting/) on some of the typical documents I would provide on a networking project. Please use these as a guide when you were trying to produce documentation for this module.
