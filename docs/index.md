# Introduction

!!! abstract "This site contains basic notes in Storage Technology for MSc on Campus."


Welcome to this program of study, __Storage__. I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11. This iteration of the module was arranged for e-delivery for remote students.

I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started.

The major areas covered in weeks 2-11 are

- Hardware
- Reliability Engineering
- Storage Organisation and Design
- Technology
- Data Storage Management

I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it.

This module is intended for students who already have some background in scripting and automation, networking and operating systems. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. The content and structure of this module was created c. 2015 and last revised in 2022. It is updated annually. 

If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my [Getting Started](https://jor-donegal.github.io/GettingStarted26/i/) notes 1 to understand what you need.
