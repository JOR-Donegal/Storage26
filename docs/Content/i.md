# Week 9
At some point, in any one of our modules, I need to cover _availability_ in depth. This week we will focus on this. You will use this in your final assignment. 

There is only one correct way to study this. 

s you learn something and get the equations for it, create a new sheet in Excel. Put in known values with known results so you can verify your sheet's accuracy.

Go through my [Availability Notes](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/storage-theory/availability-theory) and create a spreadsheet with multiple tabs to summarize your learning.
