# Week 8
For the first time this week, we're going to examine storage appliances and implement one of them.

## Theory
I need to cover some simple [storage technology](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/storage-theory/technology) to begin

## Practice
In this week's practical work, I want you to directly examine _Network Attached Storage_ (NAS). The definition for devices is often a little nebulous, but for my modules a NAS is a general purpose device to do file and block storage, and it may have a range of other functions.

If I am working with a small business to define requirements and solutions for data storage, I will propose a cloud solution like Office 365. If the customer has constraints on their connectivity or does not want data in the cloud, a NAS is usually the correct answer. I would only propose a file server and domain controller once the business was big enough to have dedicated technical support staff. 

One of the most common and popular brands in use in Ireland is __Synology__. In this exercise, you are required to investigate a suitable Synology NAS for an SME which does have Internet connectivity. You want to store data locally but ideally you will have internet connectivity, cloud backup and disaster recovery.

Investigate [this product](https://demo.synology.com/en-global) via the web demo.

Identify:

- A suitable model of Synology NAS for an SME.
- The storage technology used by this device (e.g., RAID, Erasure Coding, other). 
- The features of this device which are of significance to the enterprise.
- The options for local encryption and security.
- Solutions for cloud backup.

It is possible to build a Synology NAS as a VM, do so as a demonstration.
