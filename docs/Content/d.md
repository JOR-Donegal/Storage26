# Week 4
This week we will finish low level work by looking at file systems. You need to understand some basic file systems before we can progress. Although FAT may seem anachronistic, we still use it for removable media. This is not suitable for server systems, in Windows Server, NTFS has more appropriate properties. Finally, there are many file system in use for Linux, we will discuss some of them.

If you want to digger deeper or into other file systems, take a look at Brian Carrier's book as mentioned previously.

## Theory
Read through and understand my notes on [File Systems Theory](https://jor-donegal.github.io/FileSystemTheory26/)  

## Practice
I need to get you to go through some exercises on file system metadata again. These exercises will be on FAT only.
