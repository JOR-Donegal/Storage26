# Week 5
We can use a conventional Windows or Linux Server for almost all our simple storage requirements. Not just for file sharing, but also for block sharing (you should know what this means!). The definition for devices is often a little nebulous, but for my modules Direct Attached Storage (DAS) is a general purpose server used for file and block storage, it may have a range of other functions.

This may take a while to implement and test, so I will leave assigning any theory work this week.

## Practice
Go through my exercises on [Windows Server Storage](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/storage-practical/windows-server-storage). If you come across new technologies, research them!
