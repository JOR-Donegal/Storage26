# Week 1
Go through my [Getting Started](https://jor-donegal.github.io/GettingStarted26/) notes before doing anything else. These notes are the same for each module, so if you have gone through these on one of my previous modules, all good. There are no deliverables for this, it is not graded.

So for this week, just some (light!) reading.

## Theory
1. I introduce some [storage fundamentals](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/storage-theory)

## Practice
1. Using a VM, I want you to so some very simple exercises.
